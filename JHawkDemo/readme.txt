Virtual Machinery JHawk Demo License

Thank you for Downloading the JHawk Demo. This is very close in appearance and functionality to the full JHawk product. The only difference is that only a small number of classes can be analysed and that some functionality relating to the import and export of data is disabled. The documentation for all of the products in the JHawk family is provided in the 'Docs' folder. You can use the 'JHawk5UserManual.pdf' document in the Docs file as your guide to the functionality of the Demo.

The exact version of this license and the terms associated with this license will be found in the license.txt file in your distribution.  By installing the product on your machine you agree to the terms  of the license. If you do not agree with the terms of the license you must remove all copies of the product from your machine.

If you have any further questions about the demo or want to give us feedback about the demo or the product feel free to contact us at info@virtualmachinery.com.

Regards
The JHawk team.
